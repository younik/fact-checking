In particular, if your input is a `[batch_size, max_tokens, embedding_dim]` tensor, the matrix multiplication works on the **max_tokens** dimension, resulting in a `[batch_size, embedding_dim]` 2D matrix. Alternatively, you can reshape the 3D input tensor from `[batch_size, max_tokens, embedding_dim]` to `[batch_size, max_tokens * embedding_dim]` and then apply the MLP layer.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer**: This error is a little bit tricky since the stack trace is not meaningful at all! This error occurs when the RNN is fed with a sequence of all 0s and pad masking is enabled (e.g. from the embedding layer). Please, check your conversion step, since there might be an error that leads to the encoding of a sentence to all 0s.\n",
